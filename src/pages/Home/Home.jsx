                <p>The NextGen Computing Lab focuses on addressing the growing challenges of modern data intensive applications such as large language models, computer vision, and digital twin technologies. As traditional computing systems reach their physical and architectural limits due to the end of Mooreâ€™s Law, Dennard scaling, and the rise of the memory wall bottleneck, our lab explores novel computing paradigms that minimize data movement and enhance energy efficiency. Aligned with major national initiatives, our research combines hardware software co-design, emerging technologies, and novel computing techniques to build scalable systems for next generation AI and scientific computing workloads.</p>
